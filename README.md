# Four card feature Section (Frontend Mentor)

This is a solution to the [Four card feature section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

### Links

-   Live Site URL: [Netlify](https://jakegodsall-four-card-feature.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   How to add a `box-shadow` to just the bottom side of a div by using a `spread-radius` equal to the negative of the `blur-radius`:

```css
box-shadow: offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius=value, spread-radius=-value, colour;
```

-   How to more effectively judge sizes using Chrome dev tool's for rapid experimentation.

### Continued development

This is the first project on which I have gone _beyond_ the specification of the challenge, by adding another viewport layout (> 1600px). I shall continue to play around like this on the next challenges, as well as going back and adding more to previous challenges.

I feel I am now quite comfortable with the flexbox skills I know. As such, I shall learn a few more to start applying on the next project.
