## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- How to add a `box-shadow` to just the bottom side of a div by using a `spread-radius` equal to the negative of the `blur-radius`: 

```css
box-shadow: offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius=value, spread-radius=-value, colour;
```

- How to more effectively judge sizes using Chrome dev tool's for rapid experimentation.


### Continued development

This is the first project on which I have gone _beyond_ the specification of the challenge, by adding another viewport layout (> 1600px). I shall continue to play around like this on the next challenges, as well as going back and adding more to previous challenges.

I feel I am now quite comfortable with the flexbox skills I know. As such, I shall learn a few more to start applying on the next project.
